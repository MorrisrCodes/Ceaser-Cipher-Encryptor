# Caesar Cipher Encryption

## Overview

Welcome to my Caesar Cipher Encryption project! This is a practice project focused on implementing the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption method, while also providing an opportunity to explore PyGui, a popular Python library for creating easy and efficient graphical user interfaces.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher Implementation**: A straightforward implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption method.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Developed using PyGui to offer a user-friendly interface for encryption and decryption operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the PyGui library installed.

To do this type in your terminal **"pip install dearpygui"**

## Usage

To use this program there are two main rules to ensure an output. Number one, do not include punctuation in your plaintext, if you were able to do this it would be easier to decipher your message, so it will return an error. Number two, do not include numbers, if your plaintext requires a number type it out.

**ie: 1 -> one**

As far as navigating the interface, there will be drop down pages. The landing page will feature the usage rules. To encrypt expand the encrypt page, it will provide you with your ciphertext and your key. To decrypt expand the decrypt page, you will then need to input both your ciphertext and key.
